# Teaching machines to tell part numbers apart

## What's in a name?

Electronic parts distributors like Digi-Key, Mouser etc assign their own internal ID (known as a SKU, or "stock keeping unit") to each product that they sell, which is usually different from the "part number" that parts manufacturers assign to their products.

For example, `SN74LVC541APWR` is a part number identifying a particular IC made by Texas Instruments. Digi-Key's assigned SKU for it is `296-8521-1-ND`. Mouser calls it `595-SN74LVC541APWR`.

Here are a few more - can you tell which one came from where?
`2N2222AUA`
`311-.15LWCT-ND`
`595-TPS65986ABZQZR`
`C0603FR-075K62L`
`581-12063C475KAT2A`

## Question: can robots tell them apart?
